#### 1. Receive the Question
Coding questions tend to be vague and underspecified on purpose to allow the interviewer to gauge the candidate's attention to detail and carefulness. <br />
Ask at least 2-3 clarifying questions.
1. Clarify assumption <br />
    - Clarify if the given diagram is a tree or a graph. If a graph allows for cycles, then a naive recursive solution would not work
    - Can you modify the original array / graph / data structure in any way?
    - How is the input stored?
    - Is the input array sorted? (e.g. for deciding between binary / linear search)
2. Clarify input value range
3. Clarify input value format
    - Values: Negative? Floating points? Empty? Null? Duplicates? Extremely large?
